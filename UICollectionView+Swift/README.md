+ Working on Remote images using AFNetworking
+ Edit/Delete Cell


## Edit/Delete Cell : 

### Objectie C : 

```objective-c
for(AlbumCell *cell in self.collectionView.visibleCells)
{
          NSIndexPath *indexPath = [self.collectionView indexPathForCell:cell];
          if ([indexPath row] != (dataArray.count - 1)){
                    //[cell.closeButton setHidden:NO];
                    cell.nameLbl.text = "Jigar M"
          }
}
```
### Swift
```swift
for item: AnyObject in self.collectionView.visibleCells(){
          var indexpath : NSIndexPath = self.collectionView.indexPathForCell(item as AlbumCell)
          var cell : AlbumCell = self.collectionView.cellForItemAtIndexPath(indexpath) as AlbumCell
          
          // Get Label
          var lbl : UILabel = cell.viewWithTag(101) as UILabel
          lbl.text = "Jigar M"
}
```

# Require
OSX 10.9.3 and Xcode 6.x (beta for now)

# Swift

This project will highlight a few of the core language features about Swift, but I would read through these documents, I found them useful to learn more about Swift and understanding teh structure and syntax of the language:
